Clinic Booking System

Project Title

Clinic Booking System Database

Description

The Clinic Booking System is a relational database designed to manage appointments, patients, doctors, clinics, and specializations for a healthcare booking platform. It facilitates efficient scheduling and tracking of medical appointments, ensuring data integrity through proper constraints and relationships. Key features include:





Storing patient and doctor profiles with unique identifiers (e.g., email).



Managing clinic details and their associated doctors.



Scheduling appointments with status tracking (Scheduled, Completed, Cancelled).


Supporting many-to-many relationships between doctors and specializations via a junction table.

Enforcing data integrity with primary keys, foreign keys, NOT NULL, and UNIQUE constraints.

The database is implemented in MySQL, with tables normalized to at least 3NF, making it suitable for integration with a web or mobile application for clinic management.
